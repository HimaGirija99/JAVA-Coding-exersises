#Description

The Swimming Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the volume of cuboid shaped pools.
1. Write a class with the name Rectangle. The class needs two fields (instance variable) with name width and length both of type double.
The class needs to have one constructor with parameters width and length both of type double and it needs to initialize the fields.
In case the width parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0.
In case the length parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the length field value to 0.
Write the following methods (instance methods):
* Method named getWidth without any parameters, it needs to return the value of width field.
* Method named getLength without any parameters, it needs to return the value of length field.
* Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated area (width * length).
2. Write a class with the name Cuboid that extends Rectangle class. The class needs one field (instance variable) with name height of type double.
The class needs to have one constructor with three parameters width, length, and height all of type double. It needs to call parent constructor and initialize a height field.
In case the height parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0.
Write the following methods (instance methods):
* Method named getHeight without any parameters, it needs to return the value of height field.
* Method named getVolume without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated volume. To calculate volume multiply the area with height.

#Method

public class Rectangle {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double width, double length) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
        if (length<0) {
            this.length = 0;
        }
        if (width<0) {
            this.width = 0;
        }
    }

    public double getLength() {
        return length;
    }
    public double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }
    public double getArea(){
        return width*length;
    }
}
public class Cuboid extends Rectangle {
    private double height;
    public Cuboid(double width, double length, double height) {
        super(width, length);
        this.height = height;
        if (height<0){
            this.height = 0;
        }
    }
    public double getHeight() {
        return height;
    }
    public double getVolume(){
        return getArea()*height;
    }
}
