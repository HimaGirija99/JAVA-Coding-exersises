#Description

Write a method named getGreatestCommonDivisor with two parameters of type int named first and second. 
If one of the parameters is < 10, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
The method should return the greatest common divisor of the two numbers (int).
The greatest common divisor is the largest positive integer that can fully divide each of the integers (i.e. without leaving a remainder).
For example 12 and 30:
12 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
30 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30
The greatest common divisor is 6 since both 12 and 30 can be divided by 6, and there is no resulting remainder.


#Method

public class GreatestCommonDivisor {
    public static int getGreatestCommonDivisor(int number1, int number2) {
        int gcd = 0;
        if (number1 < 10 || number2 < 10) {
            return -1;
        } else if (number1 != number2) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= number1 && i <= number2; i++) {
                if (number1 % i == 0 && number2 % i == 0) {
                    gcd = i;
                }
            }
        }
        return gcd;

    }
    
}
