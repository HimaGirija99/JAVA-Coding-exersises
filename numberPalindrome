#Description

Write a method called isPalindrome with one int parameter called number.
The method needs to return a boolean.
It should return true if the number is a palindrome number otherwise it should return false.
Find the the reverse of the given number. Store it in some variable say reverse. Compare the number with reverse.
If both are the the same then the number is a palindrome otherwise it is not.
Declare and initialize another variable to store the reverse of a number, for example reverse = 0.
Extract the last digit of the given number by performing the modulo division (remainder).
Store the last digit to some variable say lastDigit = num % 10.
Increase the place value of reverse by one.
To increase place value multiply the reverse variable by 10 e.g. reverse = reverse * 10.
Add lastDigit to reverse.
Since the last digit of the number is processed, remove the last digit of num. To remove the last digit divide number by 10.
Repeat steps until number is not equal to (or greater than) zero. 

#Method
public class NumberPalindrome {
    public static boolean isPalindrome(int number) {
        int reverse = 0;
        int num = number;
        //125 / 10 = 12, 12*10 = 120, 125-120 = 5
        while (num != 0){
            //extract the least significant digit
            int lastDigit = num % 10;
            reverse = reverse*10+lastDigit;
            num /= 10;
        }
        if (number == reverse) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
 
}
